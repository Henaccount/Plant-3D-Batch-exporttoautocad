# Plant-3D-Batch-exporttoautocad

This tool (proof-of-concept, sample code, use at own risk) is exporting all project files as AutoCAD. It keeps the folder structure for the export. There are two commands, one for P&ID project files and another one for Plant 3D project files. "related files" are not included in the export, as they should be already plain AutoCAD.

How to use the script:

BatchExportToAutoCAD – exports 3d files, destination selection by file dialog

PnIdBatchExportToAutoCAD – exports PnID files, destination selection by file dialog

BatchExportToAutoCADHL – exports 3d files, destination by text input, this is good for batching the command, e.g.:

<pre>batchexporttoautocadhl "D:\Downloads\metric2023\Plant 3D Models" "D:\Downloads\test"</pre>

(command "sourcefolder of Plant 3D models" "destination folder of exported AutoCAD")

PnIdBatchExportToAutoCADHL – exports PnID files, destination by text input, this is good for batching the command
